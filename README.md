# jChess
Simple yet powerful 2D/3D chess game, written in Java using the Processing P3D Renderer

Developed by Ibrahim Chehab and Fardeen Kasmani

## Why, Ibrahim? Why chess
Well for starters, I don't know how to play chess and I thought this would be a cool way to learn (sidenote, this led to an insane amount of "bugs" that weren't bugs. My code was fine, I just didn't know how the game worked)

I decided to challenge myself to use the P3D renderer. I had never created anything in 3D space and thought it would be a cool challenge. My partner in crime, Fardeen, was dragged along my infinite brainsurges of ideas; Some useless, some never to see the light of day, heck some he implemented himself!

This chess game imcludes my new UltraProteccV7 licence protection scheme. It's fairly basic as I don't have a math degree, but regardless it'll get the job done :)
