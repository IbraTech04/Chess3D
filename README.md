# jChess
Simple yet powerful 2D/3D chess game, written in Java using the Processing P3D Renderer

Developed by Ibrahim Chehab and Fardeen Kasmani

## Why, Ibrahim? Why chess
Well for starters, I don't know how to play chess and I thought this would be a cool way to learn (sidenote, this led to an insane amount of hillarious "bugs" that weren't bugs. My code was fine, I just didn't know how the game worked)

I decided to challenge myself to use the P3D renderer. I had never created anything in 3D space and thought it would be a cool challenge. My partner in crime, Fardeen, was dragged along my infinite brainsurges of ideas; Some useless, some never to see the light of day, heck some he implemented himself!

This chess game imcludes my new UltraProteccV7 licence protection scheme. It's fairly basic as I don't have a math degree, but regardless it'll get the job done :) It expands the availible character set to include letters! It also no longer has set set-sizes, only set key sizes. You can find the UltraProteccV7 KeyGen and documentation on my GitHub... well when I finish it anyway. 

## Features:

* System requirements check:
  * Let's be real - I'm not a software engineer.... yet ðŸ˜„ I don't write the most optimized code in the world, and the Processing P3D renderer doesn't really help with that either. So to be safe (and hopefully not fry anyones system), I added a minimum system requirements check that runs when you first start the game. If your computer doesnt meet our "reasonable" requirements, you have the option of either continuing in 3D mode like a rebel, swap over to 2D mode, or just exit the game entirely. 
  
 * UltraProteccV7:
  * So for whatever reason I decided to add a licence key system to an open source game... Yeah....
  
* Customizable Colours
 * All those *other* chess games out there don't let you change your grid color. *Pfft* With jChess you can select custom grid, piece, and UI colours! Now why any normal user would go through and change all that is beyond me, but hey it was easy so why not :)
